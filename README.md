# rbf_levelset

A level-set description for 2D shapes exploiting radial basis functions. The goal is to be able to describe shapes by tuning the centers and the beta values of radial basis functions.

As of now, the code is able to generate randomly sampled shapes and to plot the zero level-set. An offset can be applied to the level-set. I/O is also functional, so the rbf description can be dropped to a file and re-read from it to re-generate previous shapes.
